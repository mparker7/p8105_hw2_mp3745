In the Mr. Trash Wheel data, there a total of 285 observations, whereas
the monthly record of precipitation for 2017 and 2018 combined has a
total of 19 observations. The precipitation dataset consists of monthly
records of the total precipitation in inches. The total amount of
precipitation recorded in 2018 was 23.5 inches. The Mr. Trash Wheel
dataset has dumpster level information regarding what was in each
dumpster that was filled up. It has information about the weight and
volume that was collected into the dumpster, and also counts of various
items, such as sports balls. The median number of sports balls in a
dumpster in 2017 was 8 balls. There is also information about the number
of homes powered by the trash collected.
